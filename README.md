This repository contains an R Notebook designed for the analysis and visualization of virus-associated data collected from various oceanic depths. The dataset includes taxonomic classifications (Domain, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species), geographical coordinates, and abundance metrics. The notebook showcases a workflow that integrates data cleaning, visualization, and diversity analysis to explore trends in virus communities across depth zones, such as surface, cline, twilight, and deep ocean.

Key features of this project include:

1. Taxonomic-level visualizations (e.g., bar plots, heatmaps) to illustrate virus abundance and diversity.
2. Customizable plotting scripts for taxa comparisons across environmental gradients like depth and latitude.

This repository is ideal for researchers and students interested in bioinformatics, marine microbiology, or ecological studies. For reproducibility, all dependencies are managed in R, with clear documentation of functions and steps in the notebook.

Feel free to contribute, fork, or submit issues to improve this project!
